# Sentiment Analysis Model
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook, Python scripts for training and inference, and the web app html file for my Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree project.

Description:
A recurent neural network is trained to determine the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. The model is built and deployed using the AWS's SageMaker service.

More specific, the RNN is implemented and trained using SageMaker's supported PyTorch functionality, then the model is deployed using the Lambda / API Gateway integration.

All the work is done using Amazon's SageMaker platform.
